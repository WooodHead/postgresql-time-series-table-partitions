postgresql-time-series-table-partitions
=======================================

Originally for monthly table partitions, more info at [imperialwicket.com](http://imperialwicket.com/postgresql-automating-monthly-table-partitions).

This currently duplicates a [similar gist](https://gist.github.com/imperialwicket/2720074), but revision maintenance and change requests were becoming burdensome.

Eventually I'll copy over data from the blog post to this readme (PR requests welcome for this and any other changes!).
